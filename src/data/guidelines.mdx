- **Collaboration Over Competition**: This isn't a startup battlefield. Help others, share knowledge, and grow together.
- **Build in Public**: Share your progress, wins, and failures. Transparency fuels inspiration.
- **Zero Ego Dev Culture**: You're not here to flex—you're here to build.
- **Inclusivity**: We welcome all backgrounds, skill levels, and perspectives.

## 🧾 Moderation & Enforcement

> We want to be <i>chill</i>, not <i>lawyers</i>, but here's how we handle issues:

- Moderators reserve the right to **warn**, **mute**, **kick**, or **ban** anyone violating the guidelines.
- Serious violations = instant ban (especially hate speech, harassment, or illegal activity).
- Repeated minor violations will result in a strike system. 3 strikes? You're out.
- Appeals can be made in good faith through official mod channels (Discord ticket or email).

  If you feel unsafe or see something wrong, <b>report it to the mods</b> immediately. We're here for you.

## 🧱 Content Guidelines

### 🚀 Sharing Projects
- Always include context, screenshots, or repo links.
- Be open to feedback—this is how we all grow.
- If it's NSFW, unethical, or built with stolen code/assets? Don't post it.

### 📚 Sharing Resources
- Credit authors and original creators when sharing content.
- Make it beginner-friendly whenever possible.
- No uploading pirated paid courses or bootcamp dumps.

### 💬 Communication Channels
- Use appropriate channels (e.g. `#frontend-help`, `#backend-help`, `#showcase`, etc.)
- Threads > spammy message chains
- Stay on topic. Keep memes in `#off-topic` or `#vibe-zone`.

<Tip title="Showcase!">
  Don't be shy—share your work! Even small wins can inspire others.
